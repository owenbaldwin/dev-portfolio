    text: "During my time at Le Wagon, I have built two web apps as part of a team in less than three weeks. One of which (FilmPod) is currently in MVP phase and will be available to film productions soon. It is about to be beta-tested by a few productions. On both projects I built and optimised the many tables required in the databases and the many features for our projects to run as effectively as possible among many other things. I was also in charge of a lot of the front end having the skills to create sleek design that both heightened the user experience and made for a smooth, easy to use interface."

    text: "I have gained a lot of experience working as a team, organising tasks, delivering under tight deadlines and solving problems while working in my other field of expertise: film composer and head of music department. I have a keen sense of creativity along with a logical mind which allow me to learn and adapt quickly. I have always received excellent feedback on all the projects I have been part of, whether it be in web development or the dozen of films I have worked on, going beyond what was expected of me."
